# Dask-Slurm Tutorial

This repository contains a tutorial on how to use Dask for numpy/image processing tasks and how to use a SLURM cluster within Dask. The tutorial is implemented in Python and uses the Cellpose library.

## Description

The tutorial provides step-by-step examples of how to process large datasets using Dask, a flexible library for parallel computing in Python. It also demonstrates how to leverage the power of a SLURM cluster to perform these computations more efficiently.

## Technologies

The tutorial uses the following technologies:

- SLURM: A highly scalable, multi-thread job scheduling system
- Dask: A flexible library for parallel computing in Python
- Cellpose: A generalist algorithm for cellular segmentation
- Python: The programming language used for the tutorial

## Prerequisites

Before you start the tutorial, make sure you have the necessary packages installed. You can find a list of the required packages in the `requirements.txt` file in this repository.

To install the requirements, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
